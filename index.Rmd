# Introduction {-}

This book contains the R version of the [GeoDa Workbook](https://geodacenter.github.io/documentation.html) developed by Luc Anselin. It accompanies the Introduction to Spatial Data Science 
course taught at the University of Chicago. Each chapter was originally developed
as a standalone lab tutorial for one week of the class. As a result, it is possible
to work through a single chapter on its own, though we recommend going from the 
beginning to the end.

## Disclaimer {-}

This book is still **actively under development** and may not work for you when you access it. For versions of the lab notebooks that have been tested and are not undergoing changes, please see the [Tutorials page](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/tutorials/) on our Spatial Analysis with R website.

## Using This Book {-}

We have developed an R data package ([`geodaData`](https://github.com/spatialanalysis/geodaData)) 
to use along with this book, so you can work through through the exercises 
immediately. To install it, run the following in your R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("spatialanalysis/geodaData")
```

## Who This Book Is For {-}

We assume that workshop attendees have used RStudio and are familiar with the basics of R.
If you need a refresher, this [R for Social Scientists](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) tutorial developed by Data Carpentry is a good place to start. Additionally, Luc Anselin's introductory R lab notes can be found on the [CSDS Tutorials page](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/tutorials).
